My personal config for the awesome window manager
===================

This config is meant to be functional (and nothing else) and the code has never been cleaned up.
Everything is based on awesome-copycats' multicolor theme (taken from https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats).
If you want to use this, feel free: I release it under BY-NC-SA_.

Also I thank https://github.com/crater2150 for his nice libraries.
